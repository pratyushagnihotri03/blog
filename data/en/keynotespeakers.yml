  abstract: "The advent of IoT has seen an explosive growth in the number of connected devices generating a large variety of data in high volumes at high velocities. The unique set of requirements posed by IoT demands innovation in the communication and information infrastructure to make them massively distributed for achieving scalability; secure against cyberattacks; highly interoperable for seamless interaction between different enabling technologies; highly flexible for collecting, fusing, mining, and processing IoT data; and easily programmable for service orchestration and application-enablement. This talk will discuss our experience developing and operating such an infrastructure across Canada as part of the Smart Applications on Virtualized Infrastructure project, highlighting some of the underlying management and security challenges. In particular, traditional human-in-the-loop management operations are costly, error-prone, and slow to adapt to changes. Automation can address these challenges and has been the holy grail of network management research for decades, however with limited practical deployment. We believe that the stars are now aligned to realize this long-term vision. This talk will discuss some of the research directions in this perspective with particular focus on programmable network monitoring leveraging network softwarization, predictive machine learning for automated management decision making, on-demand orchestration of network services, and IoT security empowered by blockchains."
  bio: "Raouf Boutaba is a University Chair Professor and Director in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. He also holds the INRIA International Chair in France. He is the founding Editor in Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (2007-2010), and the current Editor-in- Chief of the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC). His research interests are in the areas of network and service management. He has published extensively in these areas and received several journal and conference Best Paper Awards such as the IEEE 2008 Fred W. Ellersick Prize Paper Award. He also received other recognitions, including the Premierâ€™s Research Excellence Award, Industry research excellence Awards, fellowships of the Faculty of Mathematics, of the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science and outstanding performance awards at the University of Waterloo. He has also received the IEEE Communications Society Hal Sobol Award and the IFIP Silver Core in 2007, the IEEE Communications Society Joe LociCero and the Dan Stokesbury awards in 2009, the Salah Aidarous award in 2012, the McNaugthon Gold Medal in 2014, the Technical Achievement Award of the IEEE Technical Committee on Information Infrastructure and Networking as well as the Donald W. McLellan Meritorious Service Award in 2016. He served as a distinguished lecturer for the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies. He is fellow of the IEEE, the Engineering Institute of Canada, the Canadian Academy of Engineering, and the Royal Society of Canada."
